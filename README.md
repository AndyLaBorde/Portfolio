# M2-Challenge
## Module 2 Challenge - Portfolio

This challenge was designed to allow bootcamp students to create a portolio that they will update throughout the duration of this bootcamp.  
This challenge gives the student complete design and creative freedom for this project. 

## User Story

AS AN employer  
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples  
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work  
WHEN I load their portfolio.  
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.  
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation.  
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.  
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work.  
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.  
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application.  
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the other.  
WHEN I click on the images of the applications.  
THEN I am taken to that deployed application.  
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices.  
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.
